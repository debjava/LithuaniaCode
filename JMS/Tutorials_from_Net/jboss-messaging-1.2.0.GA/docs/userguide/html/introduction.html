      JBoss Messaging provides an open source and standards-based messaging platform that brings
      enterprise-class messaging to the mass market.
   </p><p>
      JBoss Messaging implements a high performance, robust messaging core that is designed to
      support the largest and most heavily utilized SOAs, enterprise service buses (ESBs) and other
      integration needs ranging from the simplest to the highest demand networks.
      It will allow you to smoothly distribute your application load across your cluster,
      intelligently balancing and utilizing each nodes CPU cycles, with no single point of failure,
      providing a highly scalable and perform-ant clustering implementation. JBoss Messaging includes
      a JMS front-end to deliver messaging in a standards-based format as well as being designed to be
     able to support other messaging protocols in the future.
   </p><p>
      JBoss Messaging will soon become an integral component of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware
      Suite (JEMS). Currently it
      is available for embedded use within the JBoss Application Server (JBossAS), and as a
      JBoss Microkernel-based stand-alone server. Work to integrate JBoss Messaging with the new
      JBoss Microcontainer is under way.
   </p><p>
      The large and vibrant JEMS developer community fosters its continued innovation and
      enterprise quality. JBoss Messaging enables more agile applications in a wide range of
      scenarios from simple messaging needs to an enterprise-wide messaging foundation and adds
      flexibility to any SOA initiative.

         JBoss Messaging 1.2.GA will become part of both Application Server Platform (JBoss 4.2
         series) and Service Integration Platform (JBoss ESB 4 series) as default JMS provider.
         Production support will be fully available for these plaforms and it will cover JBoss
         Messaging.
      </p><p>
         Red Hat is also working on introducing a development support program, which is different
         from production support and caters to companies who want to have a safety net even from
         the development phase. The estimated availability date of this support progam is April
         2007.

         JBoss Messaging provides:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
               A fully compatible and Sun certified JMS 1.1 implementation, that currently works
               with a standard JBossAS 4.0.x, 4.2.x and JBoss 5.x installation and also as a JBoss
               Microkernel-based standalone deployment.
            </p></li><li><p>
               A strong focus on performance, reliability and scalability with high throughput and
               low latency. JBoss Messaging already exceeds JBoss MQ in a number of measured
               performance metrics. Full results will follow.
            </p></li><li><p>
               A foundation for JBoss ESB for SOA initiatives; JBoss ESB uses
               JBoss Messaging as its foundation.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
         JBoss Messaging consists of two major parts:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
               JBoss Messaging Core &#8211; a transactional, reliable messaging transport system.
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
                     Supports generalized messages (not just JMS)

            </p></li></ul></div><p>
         Other JBoss Messaging features include:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
               Publish-subscribe and point-to-point messaging models
            </p></li><li><p>

            </p></li></ul></div><p>
         JBoss Messaging 1.2.0.GA Clustering provides the following features:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
               Distributed queues. Messages sent to a distributed queue while attached to a
               particular node will be routed to a queue instance on a particular node according
               to a routing policy.
            </p></li><li><p>
               Distributed topics. Messages sent to a distributed topic while attached at a
               particular node will be received by subscriptions on other nodes.
            </p></li><li><p>
               Fully reliable message distribution. Once and only once delivery is fully guaranteed.
               When sending messages to a topic with multiple durable subscriptions
               across a cluster we guarantee that message reaches all the subscriptions
               (or none of them in case of failure).
            </p></li><li><p>
                  Pluggable routing implementation. The policy for routing messages to a queue is fully
                     pluggable and easily replaceable. The default policy always chooses a queue at the local
                     node if there is one, and if not, it round robins between queues on different nodes.
            </p></li><li><p>
                  Intelligent message redistribution policy. Messages are automatically distributed between
                     nodes depending on how fast or slow consumers are on certain nodes. If there are no or slow
                     consumers on a particular queue node, messages will be pulled from that queue to a queue with
                     faster consumers on a different node. The policy is fully pluggable.
            </p></li><li><p>
                  Shared durable subscriptions. Consumers can connect to the same durable subscription while
                     attached to different nodes. This allows processing load from durable subscriptions to be
                     distributed across the cluster in a similar way to queues.
            </p></li><li><p>
                  High availability and seamless fail-over. If the node you are connected to fails, you
                     will automatically fail over to another node and will not lose any persistent messages.
                     You can carry on with your session seamlessly where you left off. Once and only once
                     delivery of persistent messages is respected at all times.
         </p></li><li><p>
               Message bridge. JBoss Messaging 1.2 contains a message bridge component which enables you to bridge messages between any two JMS1.1 destinations
               on the same or physical separate locations. (E.g. separated by a WAN)
         </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="compatibility"></a>2.3.&nbsp;Compatibility with JBossMQ</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
         JBossMQ is the JMS implementation currently shipped within JBossAS.
         Since JBoss Messaging is JMS 1.1 and JMS 1.0.2b compatible, the JMS code  written against
         JBossMQ will run with JBoss Messaging without any changes.
      </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
         Even if JBoss Messaging deployment descriptors are very similar to JBoss MQ
         deployment descriptors, they are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> identical, so they will require
         some simple adjustments to get them to work with JBoss Messaging. Also, the database
         data model is completely different, so don't attempt to use JBoss Messaging with a JBossMQ
         data schema and vice-versa.
      </div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="missingfeatures"></a>2.4.&nbsp;
      Features not yet available in the 1.2.0.GA release, but coming soon

    All the final features are available apart from:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              In a very near future, it will be possible to guarantee persistent level reliability
               guarantee without persistence. By replicating persistent messages between nodes in
               memory, we can obtain comparable reliability levels to persisting messages to disk,
               without actually storing them to disk. However, this feature is not available
               in the 1.2.0.GA release. If you're interested in how this feature will be available,
               this is the JIRA issue you can use to track it:
